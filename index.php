                <p>Many years ago on a tv series called Myth busters, the hosts conducted an 
                    experiment on an old television game show.
                    
                    <br><br>
                    The stages were as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>

                <li>The contestants would pick one out 
                    of three doors which they thought the games prize would be behind.</li>
                <li>When the contestant picked a door, one door which was known not to have the prize
                    behind it, would be taken away as an option.</li>
                <li>The contestant were proposed with
                    the option of staying with their first gut feeling or switching to the other door. </li>
                <li>The decision is now final and the chosen door is revealed. </li>
                </ul>
                    
                     
                <div class='center'>
                    <a href="stay-or-switch.php" class="btn btn-primary inline">Stay or Switch</a>

            </div>
            <div class="col-6 center">
                <h4 class="center">Conundrum</h4>
                <p>This is based on the third project 'Conundrum' that I completed in my 
                    full stack web development course.
                    The purpose of this was to repeat something I was already familiar but using the 
                    language php, instead of the projects previous language python and the flask framework.
